// web pack
 Create webpack.config.client.js, webpack.config.server.js, and webpack.config.client.production.js files in your project folder

they all have the same structure

const path = require('path')
const webpack = require('webpack')
const CURRENT_WORKING_DIR = process.cwd()
const config = { ... }
module.exports = config

//Nodemon.json - setup mnodemon to monitoring changes

//frontend views with react
-template.js that will render the HTML with react components

add two react files main.js (renders the toplevel react components in div), helloworldjs(basic helloworld react component )

//setup server with express and Nodemon
implement the Node-Express app, which initiates client-side code bundling, starts the server, sets up the path to serve static assets to the client, and renders the React view in a template when a GET request is made to the root route
    /bundling react app devBundle.js
    initialize Webpack to compile the client-side code when the server is run. 

    /Serving static files from the dist folder
    To make these static files available on requests from the client side, we will add the following code in server.js to serve static files from the dist folder

    /Rendering templates at the root
    When the server receives a request at the root URL /, we will render template.js in the browser
    then configure the app to start server listening at specified port

    /Connecting the server to MongoDB
    makesure you have a MongoDB instance 

    /run script
    update package.json with scripts
    run development - yarn development
    run build -yarn build
    run bundled code - yarn start
